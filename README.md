pygame pong, first attempt


This is the first pong-like game I made with pygame. I used the pygame docs and some video tutorials (ClearCode and a couple others)
to get a handle on how to get the basic loop working properly. The rest of the game logic I worked out on my own.

One player. Move paddle with W/S. Pretty simple game.
